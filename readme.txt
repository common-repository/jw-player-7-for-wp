JW Player 7 for Wordpress gives you all what you need to publish videos on your posts and pages, with the new JW7.
Skins, position, share.

== Description ==
**JW Player 7 for Wordpress** works with the self-hosted version of JW Player 7, that means that you have to:<br>

* Register a JW Player account at http://www.jwplayer.com/sign-up/
* Once you're logged in, download the player and copy your Licence key from https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/players/downloads
* Upload the folder to your site
* Add the full url of **jwplayer.js** that you just uploaded, in the admin page of the plugin; it will be something like http://example.com/FOLDER-UPLOADED/jwplayer.js
* Paste your Licence Key to the admin page of the plugin.

After that, set your general preferences, choose the post types where you want to add video and start to add content using the JW Player box that you'll find there.<br>
Just add the url of your self-hosted video, YouTube video or MP3.<br>
That's all, you're ready to go!
